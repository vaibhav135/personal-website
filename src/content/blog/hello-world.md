## Welcome to my corner of the internet

This is my first post on the new site. Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and styled to look like **Neovim** with the Dracula theme.

### Why Neovim?

Because I spend most of my time in it anyway. Might as well make my website feel like home.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro 5
- **Theme**: Dracula
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Font**: JetBrains Mono

### Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string): string => {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to my blog.`;
};

console.log(greeting("world"));
```

Stay tuned for more posts.
