## hey there

I'm Vaibhav — a Founding Fullstack Engineer based in India, working remotely. Day to day, I work across Next.js, Python (FastAPI), and LiveKit — these days I'm deep in voice agents and the workflows that revolve around them.

And in the evenings, I argue with Neovim configs I'll never finish tweaking.

## how it started

I got into coding because of game dev. The idea that you could build entire worlds from scratch — the logic, the visuals, the rules — that pulled me in hard. I never ended up shipping a game (yet), but that curiosity led me down the rabbit hole of web engineering, startups, and eventually open source.

Somewhere along the way I realized I just like *making things*. Games, apps, tools — the medium doesn't matter as much as the act of building.

## what I care about

I'm drawn to work where I can grow — and not just as an engineer. The best teams I've been on pushed me in ways that had nothing to do with code. How to think about problems, how to communicate, how to ship things that actually matter to people.

Title inflation doesn't interest me. Getting better does.

## when I'm not coding

Movies and music, mostly. If you haven't watched *The Lunchbox*, go fix that — it's one of those films that stays with you quietly. Beyond that, I'm not doing anything particularly impressive. Just trying to enjoy the little things.

## why this blog

I wanted a place to write about things I learn, things I build, and occasionally things that have nothing to do with either. No publishing schedule, no content strategy — just thoughts when I have them.

Thanks for stopping by. Stay a while.
